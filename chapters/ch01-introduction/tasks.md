## Exersice solutions for Chapter 1 - Introduction
*review after finishing reading the book*

### 1.1 
**Q:** Define in your own words: 
(a) intelligence, 
(b) artificial intelligence, 
(c) agent, 
(d) rationality, 
(e) logical reasoning.

**A:**
    intelligence - finding patterns, learning from past mistakes and being aware of the environment around you
    artificial intelligence - our approach to model that
    agent - a think that interracts with its environment
    rationality - doing the most beneficial thing for you when fronted with a choice
    logical reasoning - taking only facts and goals in mind when decision making

### 1.2 
**Q:** Read Turing's original paper on Al (Turing, 1950). In the paper, he discusses several objections to his proposed enterprise and his test for intelligence. Which objections still carry weight? Are his refutations valid? Can you think of new objections arising from developments since he wrote the paper? In the paper, he predicts that, by the year 2000. a computer will have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test with an unskilled interrogator.
What chance do you think a computer would have today? In another 50 years?
**A:**

### 1.3 
**Q:** Are reflex actions (such as flinching from a hot stove) rational? Are they intelligent?

**A:** Reflexes could be rational though they are not the result of rational thinking as they require no thinking. I think they are evolutionary advantage. In the same line of thought they are intelligent as they are a result of being aware of your surroundings and maybe learning from when you burned yourself as a child.

### 1.4 
**Q:** Suppose we extend Evans's ANALOGY program so that it can score 200 on a standard IQ test. Would we then have it program more intelligent than a human? Explain.
**A:**

### 1.5 
**Q:** The neural structure of the sea slug Aplysia has been widely studied (first by Nobel Laureate Eric Kandel) because it has only about 20,000 neurons, most of them large and easily manipulated. Assuming that the cycle time for an Aplysia neuron is roughly the same as for a human neuron, how does the computational power, in terms of memory updates per second, compare with the high-end computer described in Figure 1.31
**A:** idk

### 1.6
**Q:** How could introspection—reporting on one's inner thoughts—be inaccurate? Could I be wrong about what I'm thinking? Discuss.

**A:** It could be inaccurate as you more than usual dont take into account the whole story but just a part. Thinking is complicated, thats why we take shortcuts and thats why social media is a demon alive in todays society. The neurochemistry at the moment is also important as we think and act differently when in different mood and mental state. 

### 1.7 
**Q:** To what extent are the following computer systems instances of artificial intelligence:
• Supermarket bar code scanners.
• Web search engines.
• Voice-activated telephone menus.
• Internet routing algorithms that respond dynamically to the state of the network.

**A:** Bar code scanners wouldn't be too intelligent. Search engines could use some recommender system which uses a profile of you to show what would interest you more or better match your beliefs. Or simply to show you adequate advertising which is a disgusting use of brain power. Voice activation should use voice and speech recognition which should then use natural language processing to execute the command. Thats some serious AI. Dynamic routing sounds like it uses complex path finding algorithms and decision making which comes close to my view of AI.

### 1.8 
**Q:** Many of the computational models of cognitive activities that have been proposed involve quite complex mathematical operations, such as convolving an image with a Gaussian or finding a minimum of the entropy function. Most humans (and certainly all animals) never learn this kind of mathematics at all, almost no one learns it before college, and almost no one can compute the convolution of a function with a Gaussian in their head. What sense does it make to say that the "vision system" is doing this kind of mathematics, whereas the actual person has no idea how to do it?

**A:** The brain doesn't do the mathematics, we do the mathematics. The mathematics is the model we have to explain to us the world around us and vision happens to be hard to understand.

### 1.9 
**Q:** Why would evolution tend to result in systems that act rationally? What goals are such systems designed to achieve?

**A:** Acting rationally saves your life when in danger. If the tiger is cute that doesn't mean you should pet it as it most likely would bite off your arm 

### 1.10
**Q:** Is AI a science, or is it engineering' Or neither or both? Explain.

**A:** It is science because it models something in the real world and it is engineering because it has to be used in the real world.

### 1.11
**Q:** "Surely computers cannot be intelligent—they can do only what their programmers tell them." Is the Liner statement true, and does it imply the former?
**A:** I want to think we can tell them to think for themselves.

### 1.12
**Q:** "Surely animals cannot be intelligent—they can do only what their genes tell them." Is the latter statement true, and does it imply the former?
**A:** Animals are still aware of their surroundings but are not aware of themselves.

### 1.13 
**Q:** "Surely animals, humans, and computers cannot be intelligent—they can do only what their constituent atoms are told to do by the laws of physics." Is the latter statement true, and does it imply the former?
**A:** Free will is a tough question. 

### 1.14
**Q:** Examine the AI literature to discover whether the following tasks can currently be solved by computers:
a. Playing a decent game of table tennis (Ping-Pong).
b. Driving in the center of Cairo, Egypt.
c. Driving in Victorville, California.
d. Buying a week's worth of groceries at the market.
e. Buying a week's worth of groceries on the Web.
f. Playing a decent game of bridge at a competitive level.
g. Discovering and proving new mathematical theorems.
h. Writing an intentionally funny story.
i. Giving competent legal advice in a specialized area of law.
j. Translating spoken English into spoken Swedish in real time.
k. Performing a complex surgical operation.
For the currently infeasible tasks, try to find out what the difficulties are and predict when, if ever, they will be overcome.
**A:**

### 1.15
**Q:** Various subfieldsof AI have held contests by defining a standard task and inviting researchers to do their best Examples include the DARPA Grand Challenge for robotic cars, The International Planning Competition, the Robocup robotic soccer league, the TREC information retrieval event, and contests in machine translation, speech recognition. Investigate five of these contests, and describe the progress made over the years. To what degree have the contests advanced toe state of the art in AI? Do what degree do they hurt the field by drawing energy away from new ideas?
**A:**
